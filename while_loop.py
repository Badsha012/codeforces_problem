#while loop
#while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression is true.
#Syntax:
#while test_expression:
#    Body of while
#The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True. After one iteration, the test expression is checked again. This process continues until the test_expression evaluates to False.
x=1
while x<=5:
    print(x)
    x+=1
